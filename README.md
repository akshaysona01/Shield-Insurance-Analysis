Shield Insurance, operating across major Indian cities like Delhi and Mumbai, wanted a 360° view of their business performance. The management team needed insights into customer growth, revenue trends, and policy performance across different sales channels and demographics.
This project consolidates these insights into a single interactive Power BI dashboard for faster, data-driven decision-making.

The management of Shield Insurance needed clarity on:
How many customers are being served, and how much revenue is generated
Daily and Month-on-Month growth trends for both customers and revenue
Performance by city, age group, and sales mode to spot opportunities and weak areas
Settlement analysis to understand claim amounts and customer stability
Ability to switch between customer/revenue trends and apply filters (sales mode, city, age group, policy ID, etc.)

In short, they required a single source of truth that provides both high-level KPIs and deep drill-down capabilities.
